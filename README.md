In this project I was making a classic snake game from using the programme language Java. 
In this game it has a fruit which the snake can use the arrow keys to move around and eat the fruit. 
When eating the fruit it moves to another random position and makes the snake bigger and makes the game mode faster when eating as many fruits. 
When the snake crashes into the black box around the sides the game is over and the player loses the game. 
When the player crashes it comes with an alert saying the game is over.
